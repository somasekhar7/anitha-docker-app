The source_code folder contains all the source code for assignment-2.
This folder contains two folders namely client and server.
The client folder contains all the source code for the front end part.The main files are:
(i)App.js- This file contains all the routing code that helps in the navigation among the pages.All the routes for the pages are created here.
(ii)Home.js - This file contains all the code for the Home page.This page mainly contains buttons to navigate to home page and addition page.
(iii)Myprofile.js- This file contains the code for the profile page.
(iv)Myadd.js-This file contains the code for the addition page.
The server folder contains the code for the backend part.This contains:
(i)server.js- This contains the node and express code for the addition page to calculate the sum of numbers taken as input in frontend and sent as request and the result is then asent as response to the addition page.
####One important thing to note is that I have first written and front end and backend codes in demo and demob folders respectively.But they were mistakenly pushed as submodules into the repository.Thats why i created new source_code folder and created client and server folders and placed this demo and demob into them and pushed them.Later I removed the demo and demob folders.
